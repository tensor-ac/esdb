# esdb benchmark overview

esdb is the enterprise security decision benchmark. it has four experimental assessments for security decisions. the current local dataset is v0.3: 9,143 cases and 13,773 questions.

## assessments and scoring

| assessment | cases | questions | source and task | split unit |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| incident classification | 1,487 | 1,487 | guide incident records; predict the provider's three-class incident grade from anonymized alert metadata | organization; 271 selected organizations |
| endpoint investigation | 669 | 1,575 | native sysmon records; connect process events and supply supporting event references, or select insufficient evidence | related captures; 50 groups |
| network classification | 3,263 | 3,263 | flow classifications from dataset publishers and a separate firewall-rule task written for this benchmark | capture family or campaign; 12 groups |
| authorization policy | 3,724 | 7,448 | source programs and access or upload requests written for this benchmark; apply the supplied policy to the evidence | source component; 133 components |

the endpoint assessment has 414 investigation cases and 255 field-extraction diagnostics. only the investigation cases belong in its primary results. related cases stay in the same partition.

the policy assessment has 3,192 source-program cases and 532 workplace requests: 266 access requests and 266 file-upload requests. case counts do not represent independent incidents. the workplace requests were written for this benchmark; they are not private chat or email records.

policy pairs change one part of the data flow, approval, destination or policy. for program cases, credit requires both the approval decision and the data dependency. endpoint pairs have the same event count and field structure. they require host, process identifier and time links; a similar path or process number cannot replace a missing link. credit requires the supporting event references.

report each assessment separately. a case is correct only when all its required answers are correct. for matched pairs, also report the percentage for which both cases are correct. include class results, answer coverage and results by source group. incident results include accuracy averaged across organizations. network results separate publisher datasets and firewall-rule decisions. ctu's background classification does not establish maliciousness, so these flows are excluded from malicious-versus-normal detection rates. failed, missing and invalid answers count as incorrect. question accuracy and probability metrics are additional diagnostics; probability metrics include the number of valid answers.

## current results

jev 1.13.0 and sev were evaluated on the same 6,044 development and calibration requests. jev returned 6,043 valid responses; one incident-classification request failed. eight sev requests failed because their full context did not fit. all failures count as incorrect. evidence, question order and answer options were unchanged. the following tables show calibration results. final test has not been evaluated.

| assessment | calibration cases | jev case accuracy | sev case accuracy | majority baseline |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| incident classification | 495 | 21.82% | 21.41% | 55.15% |
| endpoint investigation | 148 | 62.16% | 30.41% | 45.95% |
| authorization policy | 1,232 | 84.42% | 47.97% | 28.57% |

the majority baselines use development data only. conventional classifiers are trained and selected using development data, with organization groups kept separate for guide. random forest reaches 59.39% on incident classification. jev never selects false positive in calibration. its accuracy averaged across organizations is 17.74%, compared with 65.65% for random forest. guide remains a retrospective classification task, with anonymized detector information; it does not establish live incident-response performance.

jev gets both cases correct in 73.21% of policy pairs and 28.38% of endpoint pairs. the individual-case scores therefore do not establish reliable answers across matched changes in policy or evidence.

| network source | calibration cases | jev accuracy | sev accuracy | jev malicious flows missed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| ctu-13 | 600 | 46.83% | 37.83% | 198 of 200 |
| iot-23 | 356 | 80.06% | 84.55% | 53 of 56 |
| splunk evidence under written firewall rules | 120 | 95.83% | 82.50% | separate rule task |

ctu accuracy includes 200 background rows; detection rates exclude them. a classifier that always predicts benign reaches 84.27% on iot-23. the cse-cic-ids2018 campaign comes from another publisher and is reserved for test. it remains unscored and is excluded from model fitting and selection. its three capture days belong to one campaign. ctu and iot share a laboratory. the network assessment still needs more independent campaigns before a broad generalization claim.

[calibration-v0.3.json](../results/calibration-v0.3.json) records the counts, source terms as recorded locally, model versions, aggregate calibration results and file hashes. it contains no request payloads, source programs, answer keys or individual predictions. the raw dataset is not included in this repository.

## local reproduction

the current build instructions require local files. a clean public checkout cannot rebuild the full dataset yet. it also needs the collected sources and local records of prior training data and source-program analysis. the source-program redistribution terms remain unresolved. download and build instructions that work from a clean checkout, and publication permissions, must be completed before a public dataset release.

get the implementation from the proposal branch:

```sh
git clone --branch proposal/esdb https://github.com/tensor-ac/decision-index.git
cd decision-index
git checkout 1457a87c66c3f473b6021df68369b8f2b608572e
```

install the construction and scoring dependencies and the pinned static parser:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -e '.[cyber,dev]'
npm ci --ignore-scripts --prefix tools/esdb
```

with the existing local source collection and analysis records, build the parent and then v0.3:

```sh
python3 -m decision_index.cyber build \
  --collection ../jevalin-collect \
  --sev-root ../Sev-security-20260925 \
  --typescript tools/esdb/node_modules/typescript/lib/typescript.js
python3 -m decision_index.cyber.v3.acquire --collection ../jevalin-collect
python3 -m decision_index.cyber.v3.cic --collection ../jevalin-collect
python3 -m decision_index.cyber.v3 build
python3 -m decision_index.cyber.v3 verify
python3 -m decision_index.cyber.v3 baselines --out runs/esdb-v03-baselines
python3 -m decision_index.cyber.v3 stage-devcal
```

generated data, review packets and model runs stay outside git. builders refuse to overwrite an existing edition. input files contain no answer keys; labels and source references are separate. the builder compares selected records with their sources and records that check. the verifier checks file hashes, structure and split boundaries; it does not repeat the source comparison. known local sev training, development and calibration overlap is excluded. public-source pretraining overlap remains unknown.

the hosted jev runner checks the served model version and records request order, failures and run identity:

```sh
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY='<your key>'
python3 scripts/esdb_jev.py --help
python3 scripts/esdb_jev.py
python3 scripts/esdb_compare_v3.py \
  --sev-results runs/sev-v03-devcal-20261004/results.jsonl \
  --jev-results runs/jev-v03-devcal-20261004/results.jsonl \
  --out runs/esdb-v03-jev-comparison.json
```

native sev inference also requires the sev runtime in the sibling repository. the included modal scripts reproduce the author's setup; they are optional and require that repository and configured provider credentials. the scripts that record model settings and run the final test currently support sev. final-test support for other models remains integration work.

shared runner changes reject resumes after input, settings, model or runtime changes. shared scorers reject mixed results and invalid probability responses. the suite verifier also requires the frozen exclusions file. these checks can reject old run directories that lack a recorded identity; start a new output directory in that case.
